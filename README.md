This program was made to compare the efficiency to insert/search/delete of the following data structures:

* Array
* Binary Tree
* Hash Table
* Heap
* Linked List

The data structures store names (char* firstName, char* lastName).\
The result are in seconds.

## Array:

Time to insert: 0.006000\
Time to search: 0.731000\
Time to delete: 0.519000

## Hash table:

Time to insert: 0.016000\
Time to search: 0.165000\
Time to delete: 0.130000

## Binary tree:

Time to insert: 0.011000\
Time to search: 0.010000\
Time to delete: 0.006000

## Heap:

Time to insert: 0.006000\
Time to search: 0.830000\
Time to delete: 0.576000

## Linked list:

Time to insert: 0.006000\
Time to search: 1.007000\
Time to delete: 0.606000

## Conclusion

Based on our findings the binary tree provided the best results.
